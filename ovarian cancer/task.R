# Task 1: Load the simulated ovarian cancer dataset

# Task 2: Display the first five rows of the dataset

# Task 3: Check if the dataset has the expected columns

# Task 4: Load library(survival)

# Task 5: Create a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and save the data as km_fit

# Task 6: Extract the number of participans from the Kaplan-Meier curve

# Task 7: Extract the p-value using the survdiff function, which performs a log-rank test for comparing survival curves between treatment groups and save the data as km_diff.

# Task 8: Set the plotting parameters for the Kaplan-Meier plot. Define the x-axis label as "Time (Months)" and the y-axis label as "Survival Probability". 
# Set the main title of the plot as "Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve". 
# Limit the x-axis to the range [0, 36] months and the y-axis to the range [0, 1].
# Set the colour for the treatment group to "blue" and for the no treatment group to "red"

# Task 9: Create a legend in the bottom-right corner of the plot. 
# Label the treatment group as "Treatment" and the no treatment group as "No Treatment". 
# Use the colors blue and red for the respective groups.

# Task 10: Cox Regression + Boxplot + HR's
